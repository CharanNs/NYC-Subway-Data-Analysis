# NYC-Subway-Data-Analysis
Project of the Nanodegree Program "Big Data Foundations", Udacity.
The Jupyter file and the html file have been attached here.
All files containing the data consumed or generated during project execution can be found in the dataset directory.

# Project Overview
In this Project, i look at NYC Subway Data to find out whether more people ride the subway when it’s raining versus when it’s not.

I will compare New York City Subway data, use statistical methods and data visualization to draw an interesting conclusion about the subway with the dataset that i have analyzed.
